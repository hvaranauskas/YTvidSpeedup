# YTvidSpeedup
Works by setting the playbackRate value of the YouTube video to the maximum value (16.0).\
Can speed up ads, so can function as a YouTube adblocker.

### TO-DO
If you go from a page on Youtube.com to a Youtube.com/watch page (e.g. from the homepage to a video), the content script which speeds up the video doesn't get executed and thus the extension doesn't work.
This can be fixed by simply refreshing the page to force the content script to get executed
