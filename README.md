# YTvidSpeedup
Basic chrome extension which allows the user to increase the playbackRate of current video on Youtube

## TO-DO
If you go from a page on Youtube.com to a Youtube.com/watch page (e.g. from the homepage to a video), the content script which speeds up the video doesn't get executed and thus the extension doesn't work.
This can be fixed by simply refreshing the page to force the content script to get executed
